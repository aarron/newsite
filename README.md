This little website tells the story of my work as a product designer, writer, and speaker. I'm rebuilding it to better showcase my work, but really just to sharpen my tools and play with design and technology.


/* Build Process */

* Run Gulp > gulp
Gulp will build Saas into CSS, compress images, minify JS, and open a browswer window to view localhost preview.

node node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp build


/* Deploy Process */

/* Notes */
* This site uses Node and Gulp

* All CSS work happens in /app/scss/styles.css
* All images live in /app/images/
